Tutorials in this section provide examples that can be imported into the form designer.

## Import/Export Tools

At the top of the form designer there are tools to help save and manage the form. You may import a form design, or export a design to save on your computer. The file is JSON format.

## Import Form
To import an example form or one of your own exported forms,

1. Hit the 'Import' button
2. Find the JSON file on your computer
3. Hit 'Open'

The imported form will load into the designer. **Be careful**, the imported form will **replace** anything you've started so you may want to import into a newly created form.

## Export Form
To export a form,

1. Hit the 'Export' button
2. Save the JSON file to your computer

Exporting forms is a great way to copy an existing design or share a design with others.
