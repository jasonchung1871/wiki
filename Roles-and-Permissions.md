Go to the Team Management page to configure role-based access for your team.

## Add New Team Member
New team members must log-in to the system (via the 'log in' button) before they can be added or have their roles updated by an existing team member. Once the new member has logged in an existing team member can assign them roles on the Team Management page.

## Roles
There are 5 roles available in the system.
| Role          | Permissions                                       |

| Team Manager  | Can add and remove team members, and assign roles |
| Form Designer | Can edit the form design and save new versions    |
| Reviewer      | Can view and download form submissions            |
| Submitter     | Can submit a team-protected form                  |
