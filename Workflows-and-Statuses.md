## How to change a submission's status

First, your form needs to have the reviewers can update the status of this form (i.e. Submitted, Assigned, Completed) enabled in order to change the submissions' status:

There are multiple statuses that you can set a submission to:

1. Assigned
2. Completed
3. Revising

## Setting a submission to assigned

As a CHEFS Admin, you can set your form to “Assigned” and assign an owner or reviewer back to the submission. This allows form admins to notify other owners/reviewers that a specific submission requires attention.

Once you select an owner/reviewer and set the submission to “Assigned”, an email will be sent to the selected owner/reviewer with a link to review the submission.

> Reviewers can see a submission that has been submitted as well as revisions as they are saved.

## Setting a submission to completed

As a CHEFS Admin, you can also set your form to “Completed”. Completed signifies that you are deeming the submission as final and should not be edited.

## Setting a submission to revising

Your form will need to have the submitters can save and edit drafts setting enabled before you can select the Revising status.

As a CHEFS Admin, you can also set your form to “Revising” and provide an email to send a notification to any form submitter. Once you set the submission to “Revising” and provide an optional message, an email is sent with the message which also links to the submission for revision.

The form Submitter should now be able to Edit the submission and make new changes to the submission. They can set the submission back as draft if need be.

Reviewers can also re-claim control of a submission when it is in the Revising state, while Submitters cannot edit the submission unless it has a 'draft' or 'revising' status.

Only submissions in draft mode can be deleted by Submitters.
