CHEFS features a new enhanced sidebar to simplify the form design process. Users may now navigate to the top and bottom of the form, preview, manage, and publish the form directly from the sidebar.

Only the ‘Top/Bottom’ navigation and ‘Collapse’ buttons are enabled by default with the other buttons being enabled as the form is populated. Once you add components to the form, the ‘Save’ button and ‘Undo/Redo’ functionality becomes enabled.
