## Save your Design

Once you’ve created a form, make sure you save your design. You can edit it anytime you wish. You can also export / import your design (as a JSON schema) for re-use in another form or by other form designers.

Once you **Save** the form, you will see this alert banner. You can preview or publish the form by clicking the blue text in the banner.

## Managing Versions

You can create a new version of your form design, using an existing version as a starting point. You do this by clicking on the plus icon next to an existing version. A new version will be in a 'draft' state until you set it as 'published' using the toggle in the table of versions.
You can only have one draft version, but you can delete that to re-start a new one if required.

**Note**: The form builder has specific components for **‘email’**, **‘phone’** or **‘number’** form fields. They look like the standard ‘text’ field, but the validation rules and appearance are slightly different and will help ensure the data you collect is in the right format.
