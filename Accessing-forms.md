## Form Access Types

A CHEFS form can be configured with the following with 'Form Access' under ‘Form Settings’ on your form management page:

![Form Access settings](images/form-access.png)

- **Public (anonymous)**: The form can be accessed and submitted by anyone. No login is required.
Use this option if you intend to use CHEFS as a survey tool and require answers to be anonymous.
- **Log-in Required**:
  - **IDIR**: To view or submit the form, the user must log in using their B.C. Government IDIR login credentials
  - **Basic BCeID**: The person submitting the form must log in using a BCeID username and password. If they don’t have a Basic BCeID, they can register for one via a hyperlink on the CHEFS login page. Once a user is registered, they will automatically return to the CHEFS form – it only takes a few minutes to register. Please remember to [Notify IDIM team about your CHEFS form](#Notify-IDIM-team-about-your-CHEFS-form) if you plan to use BCeID
If the submitter has to log in to CHEFS to submit the form, CHEFS can link the form submission to a user account and include more features. 
Requiring a user to log in will give them more options, such as:
* The submitter can save a draft of their submission, continue editing a draft and submit it later
* Viewing their previous submissions of a form
* Receive notifications and be part of a workflow with whoever reviews submissions
Requiring a log-in also secures access to your form if it is only intended for a limited audience.

- **Specific Team Members**: This option allows you to limit access to your form to a smaller group of users that you invite through the *Team Management* section of the Admin panel.

Note: Access to the Admin panel is restricted to users who have an IDIR. See the [Admin team management](Admin team management) section of the user guide for more details.

### Please notify the IDIM team if you are using BCeID

If you decide to use the **'Log-in Required - Basic BCeID'** setting for your form access, you must notify the Identity Information Management (IDIM) team by email (IDIM.Consulting@gov.bc.ca). They need to know which applications are using the BCeID service and allocate appropriate resources. You should provide them the following in your notification:

- Program area or initiative that owns the CHEFS form
- Contact Email address
- Estimate of how many submissions the form may receive per year

There are a few steps that IDIM will follow up and work with you on including a self-assessment and a signed Service Agreement.
