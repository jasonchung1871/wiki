## To set form access

You can choose from three levels of access for your form – **Public**, **Log-in Required**, and **Specific Team Members** (Figure 1).

Each option comes with its own set of considerations.

**Public (anonymous)**

The public option gives anyone access to your from, whether inside or outside government. 
Choose Public if you want to run an anonymous survey.

Some of the limitations when choosing Public as your access level are:
* The submitter cannot save their submission to finish later.
* The submitter cannot share their submission with others before they submit.

**Log-in required**

Requiring a submitter to log in limits your form to anyone with a **Basic BCeID**, **Business BCeID** or **IDIR** username and password. 

Requiring a log in enables several features for submitters. 
Submitters can:
* Save their submission and finish it later.
* Share their submission with colleagues.
* Use workflows.
* Review all their previous submissions. 

Requiring a login has some limitations:
* You can only select one of the BCeIDs or IDIR; you cannot allow both.
* Users often find getting a BCeID confusing.

**Specific Team Members**

If you only want a small group of people to access your form, choose **Specific Team Members**. 
To invite team members:

1. Click **My Forms**.
2. From your list of forms, click **Manage** for the form you want to update.
3. Click **Team Management** (Figure 2) on the **Manage Form** page.

## Notify the IDIM team if you are using BCeID

If you decide to use the **'Log-in Required - Basic BCeID'** setting for your form access, you must notify the Identity Information Management (IDIM) team by email (IDIM.Consulting@gov.bc.ca). They need to know which applications are using the BCeID service and allocate appropriate resources. You should provide them the following in your notification:

* Program area or initiative that owns the CHEFS form
* Contact Email address
* Estimate of how many submissions the form may receive per year

There are a few steps that IDIM will follow up and work with you on including a self-assessment and a signed Service Agreement:

*	Submission of a BCeID onboarding self assessment to IDIM.Consulting@gov.bc.ca ( Client responsibility ) 
*	Participation in Client | BCeID onboarding kickoff meeting ( Joint Client | IDIM responsibility ) 
*	Client Supplementary Service added to Schedule B of the CHEFS Service Agreement ( Joint Client | IDIM responsibility) 
*	Review & Signoff of Updated Service Agreement(s) (Client responsibility) 
*	Creation of Online Service Directory (OSD) entries in BCeID application as part of your audit record (Client responsibility) 
*	Submission of your project’s communications / invitations to the Public (that mention BCeID) submitted to IDIM.Consulting@gov.bc.ca for review & signoff (Client responsibility) 
*	Notify IDIM Consulting what your target Production Go-Live | BCeID account First Users date is - (please notify them if previously disclosed dates are moved or changed) (Client responsibility) 
*	Provide estimates of BCeID end user account volumes (by BCeID account type) a) at launch and b) after the first year of operation - (please notify them if previously disclosed end user BCeID account volumes change) (Client responsibility) 

Additional forms created for a similar purpose and similar customer base may not have to go past the self-assessment step but IDIM Consulting will advise you on that.

> **Note:** BCeID users cannot be added to your form as an administrator. See [Managing admin teams](Managing-admin-teams) for more details on how to add administrators to you form.
