## Form access types

A CHEFS form can be configured with the following with 'Form Access' under ‘Form Settings’ on your form management page:

![Form Access settings](images/form-access.png)

<ul>
<li><strong>Public (anonymous):</strong> The form can be accessed and submitted by anyone. No login is required.
Use this option if you intend to use CHEFS as a survey tool and require answers to be anonymous.
</li>
<li><strong>Log-in Required:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>IDIR:</strong> To view or submit the form, the user must log in using their B.C. Government IDIR login credentials</li>
<li><strong>Basic BCeID:</strong> The person submitting the form must log in using a BCeID username and password. If they don’t have a Basic BCeID, they can register for one via a hyperlink on the CHEFS login page. Once a user is registered, they will automatically return to the CHEFS form – it only takes a few minutes to register. Please remember to <a href="#Notify-the-idim-team-if-you-are-using-bceid">Notify the IDIM team if you are using BCeID</a> if you plan to use BCeID

<p>If the submitter has to log in to CHEFS to submit the form, CHEFS can link the form submission to a user account and include more features. <p>
<p>Requiring a user to log in will give them more options, such as:
<ul>
<li>The submitter can save a draft of their submission, continue editing a draft and submit it later</li>
<li>Viewing their previous submissions of a form</li>
<li>Receive notifications and be part of a workflow with whoever reviews submissions</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Requiring a log-in also secures access to your form if it is only intended for a limited audience.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Specific Team Members:</strong> This option allows you to limit access to your form to a smaller group of users that you invite through the "Team Management" section of the Admin panel.</li>
</ul>
<br />

> **Note:** The administration panel is restricted to users who have an IDIR. See [Managing admin teams](Managing-admin-teams) for more details on how to add administrators to you form.

## Notify the IDIM team if you are using BCeID

If you decide to use the **'Log-in Required - Basic BCeID'** setting for your form access, you must notify the Identity Information Management (IDIM) team by email (IDIM.Consulting@gov.bc.ca). They need to know which applications are using the BCeID service and allocate appropriate resources. You should provide them the following in your notification:

* Program area or initiative that owns the CHEFS form
* Contact Email address
* Estimate of how many submissions the form may receive per year

There are a few steps that IDIM will follow up and work with you on including a self-assessment and a signed Service Agreement.

> **Note:** BCeID users cannot be added to your form as an administrator. See [Managing admin teams](Managing-admin-teams) for more details on how to add administrators to you form.
