## How it works for the submitter

The person filling in the form can invite team members to edit it when it is a draft. They invite your team members by clicking the "Manage Team Members" icon.

* The team member needs to have already logged in to CHEFS for you to find them in this search
* The submitter enters the team member's name, email, or username
* The submitter needs to copy the submission URL and send it to their team member(s).

Once the form is submitted, they cannot edit anymore.
