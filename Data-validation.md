The form designer can define validation rules on a form field. For example, they can set:

* Required fields
* Required format 
* Custom rules

When someone submits a form, validation errors will pop up, informing them their input does not match the validation rules.

## Validating data with an external sources

A CHEFS form field can populate or verify data from an external source by connecting through an unsecured API endpoint. You can do this by writing a javascript pasted into the form field's settings.
