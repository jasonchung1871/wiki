## Components
[Bootstrap Components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/) can be added using the `Layout > HTML Element` in Advanced Fields. Copy and paste components from the examples on the Bootstrap site. There are also a few samples implemented here in the working example.

You can either paste examples directly into the `content` field or into the `HTML Tag` and `CSS Class` fields like this:

![HTML Tag: div, CSS Class: alert alert-primary](images/bs_alert_example.png)

You'll find some components built into simple and advanced fields like Panel. Other options are also available in components like adding prefix and suffix to input groups.

## Utilities
Experiment with [Bootstrap Utilities](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/) to add custom styles to your form.

## Columns
Use [Bootstrap Grids](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/) to customize columns. A form is 12 columns wide, divide it up any way you like (6x2, 4x3, 10+2, etc). There are some pre-set column widths in Simple Fields. In Advanced Fields, here's an example of 4 columns of width 3 (4 X 3 = 12):

You can also nest columns, that is to say put columns inside of other components like a panel or even another parent column component.

## Icons
Add icons to buttons and input fields from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/).

### Button Icons

Example, enter “fa fa-plus” in one of the button icon fields.

### Input Icons or Text
You can add an input icon in front of a field by adding an HTML tag into the “Prefix” field. <I class=”fa fa-phone”></i>.
